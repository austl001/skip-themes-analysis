# Introduction

## Background

On 3rd December 2021, Castle Water raised a Change Proposal (CP) that proposed suspending charges on the Market Performance Standards (MPS) MPS17, MPS18 and MPS19 until the reform of the Market Performance Framework (MPF) has been completed ([CPM048 & CPW131: Suspending certain MPS charges pending full review of the MPF](https://mosl.co.uk/change/changes/suspending-certain-mps-charges-pending-full-review-of-the-mpf)). Their position is that a significant level of performance charges incurred by retailers are due to causes outside retailer control.

To evidence lack of control over performance failures, retailers were asked to provide SKIP data for a random sample of missed meter read submissions that incurred a performance charge between April and December 2021. Retailers were also asked to  categorise the SKIPs to provide insight into whether they were outside or within the retailer's control. This data can then be used to assess whether it would be reasonable to suspend performance charges or not. 

Note that not all retailers provided data as it was optional. 

## Summary

This report shows MOSL's findings from an analysis of the SKIP code and performance data provided by retailers to assess the extent to which performance failures are within retailers' control. 

We used the initial categorisations provided by retailers and made *a priori* assumptions regarding whether they were outside or within retailer control. These assumptions were then radically updated using text analysis to identify themes within the SKIP data. These themes provided clearer evidence for performance failures to be labelled as outside or within retailer control. 

We found that performance failures in the sample likely to be outside retailer control ranges between 30-80%. This large range is due to having several options for treating the 40% of performance failures that were unspecified or uncategorised by retailers or lacked any detailed information that would enable MOSL to reliably assign control of the performance failure. 

We have identified the following options for treating unmatched and uncategorised SKIPs (with the resulting overall percentage of performance failures outside retailer control):

1. Include and categorise control as “unknown” (36% of SKIPs outside retailer control) 
1. Include and assume within retailer control (36%)
1. Include and assume outside retailer control (85%)
1. Exclude from the sample or weighted re-assignment to other themes (71%)
1. Unweighted re-assignment to other themes (68%)
1. Probabilistic re-assignment of control using classification model (40%)

Based on our assessment of each of the themes, we recommend using the classification model to re-assign control. This suggests approximately 40% of performance failures were outside retailer control.

Lastly, we considered the relationship of these performance failures with the stipulation introduced by CPW030 into CSD0002 that five percent of total MPS18 and MPS19 tasks may fail without incurring a charge. This allowance, although controversial, was intended to protect retailers from performance failures and charges outside their control. We found that, with an average MPS performance of 88% during the period, and assuming 40% performance failures outside retailer control, the "net exposure" of retailers to charges outside their control was 5%. This analysis therefore provides evidence that the allowance is too low to account for the volume of performance failures outside retailer control. Instead, we found that a minimum allowance of 20% would be required to eliminate the net exposure to failures outside retailer control. 

Our recommendations are the following:

* The charging framework should be reviewed as a high priority as part of the MPF reform due to the relatively high level of performance failures outside retailer control
* In particular, a more detailed review of performance failures outside retailer control (especially access issues) is required to fully assess their impact and identify mitigations and/or resolutions
* However, whilst the level of performance failures outside retailer control is high, we note that this is at least partially mitigated by the allowance; and so it is questionable whether an immediate and full suspension of MPS charges is justified given the average 5% net exposure to retailers after taking into account the 5% allowance
* Another possible near-term response to consider would be to sufficiently increase the 5% allowance to reduce or eliminate retailer's net exposure to performance failures outside their control.

We also note the following points:

* Longer, more detailed SKIP descriptions indicate performance failures that are more likely to be outside retailer control, whereas shorter SKIP descriptions are more likely to be within retailer control; and this may indicate that meter reading service providers generally provide more detail when the wholesaler needs to resolve an issue.
* Retailers with higher performance are more likely to have a higher proportion of performance failures outside their control, whereas poor performers tend to have a more balanced mix of failures within and outside their control: this could be because good-performers would be expected to succeed on tasks within their control but fail on those outside their control, whereas the failures of poor-performers would be more randomly distributed between outside and within their control
* On average, meter read failures outside the retailer's control (and which are largely within the wholesaler's control) are more likely to become and remain long unread, which would lead to repeat performance charges; whereas, those within retailer control are more likely to be resolved or not become long unread in the first place.
